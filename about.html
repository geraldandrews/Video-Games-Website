            <h3>what is video gaming</h3>
            <p>
              Video games are electronic games that involve interactions between the user and input devices and user
              interfaces such as a joystick, keyboard, controller, or a motion sensing device that generate visual
              feedback. This feedback is shown on devices such as televisions, monitors, touchscreens, and virtual
              reality headsets. Video games can also give audio feedback through speakers and headphones. Video games 
              come in different platforms which include arcade games, console games, and personal computer or PC
              games. Some of the more recent video games have evolved into mobile gaming through smartphones, tablet
              computers, reality systems, and cloud gaming.

               contain buttons, directional control buttons, or joysticks for the purpose of the user interacting 
               with and controlling images and characters on the screen. These days console games usually come in the 
               form of optical disc, ROM cartridge, digital download, or dedicated consoles with built in video games.

            <p>
                Arcade games are entertainment machines operated by coins and can usually be found in public businesses 
                such as arcades, shopping centers, restaurants, bars, and even homes. Arcade games are operated with 
                computerized circuitry that take input from their players and then displayed electronically on screens 
                similar to huge monitors or televisions. There are other versions of arcade games which are 
                carnival games where players play for tickets and prizes, merchandiser games such as claw crane games 
                where the player attempts win a prize by pulling it up with the claw crane, and pinball machines. 
                Pinball machines allow a player to score as many points as possible by keeping a steel ball in play 
                with flippers. Arcade video games have declined considerably since the 2000s, however they remain a 
                popular option for entertainment and fun.
