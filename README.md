# Video Games Website
### Live Site: https://gamestech.netlify.app/

## Description
This is a website I created devoted to something I have enjoyed doing over the years, video games. This website consists of the history of some of the most memorable and best selling video games and video game consoles that have been on the market throughout the years. I created this website from scratch using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and some video game and video game console images I have collected from online.
